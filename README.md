# HMU02
Marketing agency: 02 challenge homework assignment,

## Description

- This project is a activity for my second week of the MSU Bootcamp Coarse.
- I had to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
- I learned so much trying to figure things out like placing images and why a link wasn't working.
- Steps that got me there were creating a new repository on GitHub account and cloning it.
- Redoing the website, using the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push the code to the GitHub repository.
- Last but not least deploying it and making it live.
